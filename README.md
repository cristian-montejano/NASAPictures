# NASAPictures

Cristian Montejano

This is a simple project that will retrieve and display a set of images in a scrollable list. The images are returned by the public NASA API. 

NASA endpoint used: https://images-api.nasa.gov

There is a random keyword pulled from a pre-determinede list that is used to query the results. Users can pull to refresh to get a new keyword.

Third party libraries used:
-Picasso (for images)
-Gson (for json parsing)
-Retrofit (for API calls)
